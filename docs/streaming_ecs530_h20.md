Because of the need to reduce mobility in Bergen, the course will be run on closed Zoom. Some videos where only the instructor is speaking may be made available later.

Please report malfunction to https://sli.do, code #67940, roger.bivand@nhh.no or as an issue on https://github.com/rsbivand/ECS530_h20. This page may well be updated, so you may need to reload it to get the freshest instructions.
